\title{Calculate the correlation between each unique pair of ensemble members.}
\usage{
independence_test(
  ensemble,
  n_ensembles = 25,
  n_lds = 5,
  detrend = TRUE,
  var_name = "tprate",
  ens_name = "number",
  ld_name = "leadtime"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ensemble}{The UNSEEN ensemble. This function expects a dataframe with the columns variable (precipitation), ensemble (number), leadtime.
It expects that the first member is 0 (as used in CDS) and that the first lead time is 2
(first month shows dependence and is therefore removed). See for example the SEAS5_UK dataset using  `?SEAS5_UK`}

\item{n_ensembles}{The number of ensemble members (not including pooled leadtimes) in the UNSEEN ensemble. Defaults to 25.}

\item{n_lds}{The number of leadtimes in the UNSEEN ensemble. Defaults to 5.}

\item{detrend}{Should the trend in the data be removed? By default, the data is detrended by differencing.}

\item{var_name}{The column name containing the variable to be analyzed. Defaults to "tprate".}

\item{ens_name}{The column name containing the ensemble members. Defaults to "number".}

\item{ld_name}{The column name containing the leadtimes. Defaults to "leadtime".}
}
\value{
A plot showing the boxplot of the pairwise correlations for each leadtime. See Kelder et al. 2020.
}
\description{
Calculate the correlation between each unique pair of ensemble members.

\section{Warning}{

The confidence intervals are based on a bootstrap test with n_ensembles = 25. These are now pre-computed and therefore
will not give the right CI bounds for different ensemble sizes. The bootstrapping test is included in the documentation in data_raw, but
might be included in the future as a function of n_ensembles and n_lds.
